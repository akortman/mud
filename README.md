# mud
A music data parsing library for deep learning projects

# Installation
Recommended install is to clone _mud_ and then `pip install .` in the base
directory (with setup.py in it). Then `import mud` and continue.

Alternatively, if you're working on _mud_, use `pip install -e .`. This will
install _mud_ symlinked to the files in this directory, so when you import you
will always get the modified library.
